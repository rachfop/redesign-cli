FROM <<BASE_IMAGE>>

# The RunPod base image pre-installs many system dependencies to help you get started quickly.
# Check the base image's Dockerfile before adding more dependencies.
# IMPORTANT: The base image overrides the default Hugging Face cache location.

# System dependencies
# If you need system dependencies that are not included in the base image, add them here.
# You must override the base image in runpod.toml with an image that includes your dependencies
# for changes to propagate to your Project pod.

# Python dependencies
COPY <<REQUIREMENTS_PATH>> /requirements.txt
RUN python<<PYTHON_VERSION>> -m pip install --upgrade pip && \
    python<<PYTHON_VERSION>> -m pip install --upgrade -r /requirements.txt --no-cache-dir && \
    rm /requirements.txt

# NOTE: The base image comes with multiple Python versions pre-installed.
#       It is recommended to specify the version of Python when running your code.
